        <LI>Meet the clients and visit the site. This can be done by Zoom (or anything similar, online) if they are from
          out of the area. At this point I will have researched zoning and bylaw information.</LI>
        <LI>Gather as much information as I can from the clients, including:
          <ul class="list-disc pl-4 pt-2">
            <li>wish list</li>
            <li>photos</li>
            <li>magazine or digital images</li>
            <li>existing furniture and art they want to use in their home</li>
          </ul>
        </LI>
        <LI>Do sections of the house site based on topographic information.</LI>
        <LI>Start sketching ideas based on the wishlist, keeping in mind sunlight, wind direction, and topography.</LI>
        <LI>Generic and existing furniture are included in this stage.</LI>
        <LI>Thumbnail sketches and plans are then presented to the client.</LI>
        <LI>Using AutoCAD, these ideas then get scaled into two or more alternative plans.</LI>
        <LI>I encourage clients to hire a professional interior designer at this point in the design.</LI>
        <LI>Preliminary Plans, including:
          <ul class="list-disc pl-4 pt-2">
            <li>tightening up floor plans</li>
            <li>a roof plan</li>
            <li>more sections</li>
            <li>at least two scaled elevations</li>
            <li>site plan with lot grading</li>
            <li>as many meetings as necessary throughout this stage is very important</li>
            <li>potentially a model or 3D rendering, depending on the complexity of the project</li>
            <li>if there are any rezoning or development permits I will generally get them started about halfway through
              the preliminary stage</li>
          </ul>
