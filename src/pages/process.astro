        <li>Meet the clients and visit the site. This can be done by Zoom (or anything similar, online) if they are from
          out of the area. At this point I will have researched zoning and bylaw information.</li>
        <li>Gather as much information as I can from the clients, including:
          <ul class="">
            <li>wish list</li>
            <li>photos</li>
            <li>magazine or digital images</li>
            <li>existing furnature and art they want to use in their home</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Do sections of the house site based on topographic information.</li>
        <li>Start sketching ideas based on the wishlist, keeping in mind sunlight, wind direction, and topography.</li>
        <li>Generic and existing furniture are included in this stage.</li>
        <li>Thumbnail sketches and plans are then presented to the client.</li>
        <li>Using AutoCAD, these ideas then get scaled into two or more alternative plans.</li>
        <li>I encourage clients to hire a professional interior designer at this point in the design.</li>
